🚀 **Just launched:** Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for seamless tool integration  
⚡ **Performance:** Adds only 11µs latency while handling 5,000+ RPS  
🛡️ **Reliability:** 100% uptime with automatic provider failover

## ⚡ Quickstart (30 seconds)

**Go from zero to production-ready AI gateway in under a minute.** Here's how:

**What You Need**

- Any AI provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, etc.)
- Node.js 18+ installed (or use Docker instead via [Docker installation](./docs/quickstart/http-transport.md))
- 20 seconds of your time ⏰

### Using Bifrost HTTP Transport

📖 For detailed setup guides with multiple providers, advanced configuration, and language examples, see [Quick Start Documentation](./docs/quickstart/http-transport.md)

**Step 1:** Start Bifrost

```bash
# 🔧 Run Bifrost binary
npx @maximhq/bifrost
```

**Step 2:** Open the built-in web interface and configure bifrost

```bash
# 🖥️ Open the web interface in your browser
open http://localhost:8080

# Or simply open http://localhost:8080 manually in your browser
```

**Step 3:** Test it works

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Bifrost! 🌈"}
    ]
  }'
```

**🎉 Boom! You're done!**

Your AI gateway is now running with a beautiful web interface. You can:

- **🖥️ Configure everything visually** - No more JSON files!
- **📊 Monitor requests in real-time** - See logs, analytics, and metrics
- **🔄 Add providers and MCP clients on-the-fly** - Scale and failover without restarts
- **🚀 Drop into existing code** - Zero changes to your OpenAI/Anthropic apps

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Bifrost is built with a modular architecture:

```

The system uses a provider-agnostic approach with well-defined interfaces to easily extend to new AI providers. All interfaces are defined in `core/schemas/` and can be used as a reference for contributions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

There are three ways to use Bifrost - choose the one that fits your needs:

### 1. As a Go Package (Core Integration)

For direct integration into your Go applications. Provides maximum performance and control.

> **📖 [2-Minute Go Package Setup](./docs/quickstart/go-package.md)**

Quick example:

```bash
go get github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core
```

### 2. As an HTTP API (Transport Layer)

For language-agnostic integration and microservices architecture.

> **📖 [30-Second HTTP Transport Setup](./docs/quickstart/http-transport.md)**

Quick example:

```bash
npx @maximhq/bifrost
```

### 3. As a Drop-in Replacement (Zero Code Changes)

Replace existing OpenAI/Anthropic APIs without changing your application code.

> **📖 [1-Minute Drop-in Integration](./docs/usage/http-transport/integrations/README.md)**

Quick example:

```diff
- base_url = "https://api.openai.com"
+ base_url = "http://localhost:8080/openai"
```

## 📊 Performance

**Bifrost adds virtually zero overhead to your AI requests.** In our sustained 5,000 RPS benchmark (see full methodology in [docs/benchmarks.md](./docs/benchmarks.md)), the gateway added only **11 µs** of overhead per request – that's **less than 0.001%** of a typical GPT-4o response time.

**Translation:** Your users won't notice Bifrost is there, but you'll sleep better knowing your AI never goes down.

| Metric                                | t3.medium | t3.xlarge   | Δ                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Added latency (Bifrost overhead)      | 59 µs     | **11 µs**   | **-81 %**          |
| Success rate @ 5 k RPS                | 100 %     | 100 %       | No failed requests |
| Avg. queue wait time                  | 47 µs     | **1.67 µs** | **-96 %**          |
| Avg. request latency (incl. provider) | 2.12 s    | **1.61 s**  | **-24 %**          |

### 🔑 Key Performance Highlights

- **Perfect Success Rate** – 100 % request success rate on both instance types even at 5 k RPS.
- **Tiny Total Overhead** – < 15 µs additional latency per request on average.
- **Efficient Queue Management** – just **1.67 µs** average wait time on the t3.xlarge test.
- **Fast Key Selection** – ~**10 ns** to pick the right weighted API key.

Bifrost is deliberately configurable so you can dial the **speed ↔ memory** trade-off:

| Config Knob                   | Effect                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initial_pool_size`           | How many objects are pre-allocated. Higher = faster, more memory |
| `buffer_size` & `concurrency` | Queue depth and max parallel workers (can be set per provider)   |
| Retry / Timeout               | Tune aggressiveness for each provider to meet your SLOs          |

Choose higher settings (like the t3.xlarge profile above) for raw speed, or lower ones (t3.medium) for reduced memory footprint – or find the sweet spot for your workload.
