// Plugin defines the interface for Bifrost plugins.

// of the processing pipeline.
// User can provide multiple plugins in the BifrostConfig.
// PreHooks are executed in the order they are registered.
// PostHooks are executed in the reverse order of PreHooks.

// PreHooks and PostHooks can be used to implement custom logic, such as:
// - Rate limiting
// - Caching
// - Logging
// - Monitoring
