## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **High-Performance Design**

- **Asynchronous request processing** with channel-based worker pools
- **Memory pool management** to minimize garbage collection
- **Provider isolation** with dedicated resource management

### **Scalability Features**

- **Horizontal scaling** with stateless architecture
- **Connection pooling** for optimal resource utilization
- **Request queuing** with configurable buffer sizes

### **Reliability Patterns**

- **Circuit breaker** patterns for provider failures
- **Fallback systems** across multiple providers
- **Graceful degradation** under high load
