This guide walks you through setting up the Bifrost repository for local development, from prerequisites to running your first development server.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the repository, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Go (Required)

Bifrost requires **Go 1.21+** for development.

```bash
# Check if Go is installed
go version

# If not installed, download from https://golang.org/dl/
# Or use package managers:

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install go

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install golang-go

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install golang
```

### Node.js and npm (Required for UI development)

The UI components require **Node.js 18+** and npm.

```bash
# Check versions
node --version
npm --version

# Install via package managers:

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs
```

### Make (Required)

Required for running development commands via the Makefile.

```bash
# Check if make is installed
make --version
```

If `make` is not installed, follow our [Install make command guide](/deployment-guides/how-to/install-make).

### Docker (Optional)

Only needed if you plan to build Docker images or test containerized deployments.

```bash
# Check if Docker is installed
docker --version

# Install from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
```

### Air (Auto-installed)

Air provides hot reloading during development. The Makefile will install it automatically when needed.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost.git
cd bifrost

# Verify the repository structure
ls -la
```

You should see the main directories: `core/`, `framework/`, `transports/`, `ui/`, `plugins/`, `docs/`, etc.

## Repository Structure

Bifrost uses a modular architecture with the following structure:

```
bifrost/
├── core/                # Core functionality and shared components
│   ├── providers/       # Provider-specific implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
│   ├── schemas/         # Interfaces and structs used throughout Bifrost
│   └── bifrost.go       # Main Bifrost implementation
├── framework/           # Framework components for common functionality
│   ├── configstore/     # Configuration storages
│   ├── logstore/        # Request logging storages
│   └── vectorstore/     # Vector storages
├── transports/          # HTTP gateway and other interface layers
│   └── bifrost-http/    # HTTP transport implementation
├── ui/                  # Web interface for HTTP gateway
├── plugins/             # First party plugins
├── docs/                # Documentation and guides
└── tests/               # Comprehensive test suites
```

The system uses a provider-agnostic approach with well-defined interfaces in `core/schemas/` for easy extension to new AI providers.

**Learn More About the Architecture:**
- **[Request Flow](/architecture/core/request-flow)** - Deep dive into how requests are processed from transport to provider
- **[Plugin System](/architecture/core/plugins)** - How plugins extend functionality
- **[Framework Components](/architecture/framework/what-is-framework)** - Shared storage and utilities
- **[MCP Integration](/architecture/core/mcp)** - Model Context Protocol implementation

## Development Environment Setup

### Quick Start (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using the complete development environment:

```bash
# Start complete development environment (UI + API with hot reload)
make dev
```

This command will:
1. Install UI dependencies automatically
2. Install Air for hot reloading
3. Set up the Go workspace with local modules
4. Start the Next.js development server (port 3000)
5. Start the API server with UI proxy (port 8080)

**Access the application at:** http://localhost:8080

<Note>The `make dev` command handles all setup automatically. You can skip the manual setup steps below if this works for you.</Note>

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up components manually:

#### 1. Install UI Dependencies

```bash
# Install UI dependencies and tools
make install-ui
```

#### 2. Install Air for Hot Reloading

```bash
# Install Air if not already installed
make install-air
```

#### 3. Set Up Go Workspace

```bash
# Set up Go workspace with all local modules
make setup-workspace
```

This creates a `go.work` file that links all local modules for development.

#### 4. Build the Application

```bash
# Build UI and binary
make build
```

#### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Run without hot reload
make run

# Or with hot reload (development)
make dev
```

## Available Make Commands

The Makefile provides numerous commands for development:

### Development Commands

```bash
make dev          # Start complete development environment (recommended)
make build        # Build UI and bifrost-http binary
make run          # Build and run (no hot reload)
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
make test         # Run bifrost-http tests
make test-core    # Run core tests
make test-plugins # Run plugin tests
make test-all     # Run all tests
```

### Workspace Management

```bash
make setup-workspace  # Set up Go workspace for local development
make work-clean      # Remove local go.work files
```

### UI Commands

```bash
make install-ui   # Install UI dependencies
make build-ui     # Build UI for production
```

### Docker Commands

```bash
make build-docker-image  # Build Docker image
make docker-run         # Run Docker container
```

### Documentation

```bash
make docs         # Start local documentation server
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make lint         # Run linter for Go code
make fmt          # Format Go code
```

## Environment Variables

You can customize the development environment with these variables:

```bash
# Server configuration
HOST=localhost                    # Server host (default: localhost)
PORT=8080                        # Server port (default: 8080)

# Logging
LOG_STYLE=json                   # Logger format: json|pretty (default: json)
LOG_LEVEL=info                   # Logger level: debug|info|warn|error (default: info)

# Prometheus
PROMETHEUS_LABELS="env=dev"      # Labels for Prometheus metrics

# App directory (for containers)
APP_DIR=/app/data               # App data directory
```

Example with custom settings:

```bash
PORT=3001 LOG_STYLE=pretty LOG_LEVEL=debug make dev
```

## Understanding Bifrost Architecture

Before diving into development, it's helpful to understand how Bifrost works internally. The architecture documentation provides detailed insights into:

### Core Components
- **[Request Flow](/architecture/core/request-flow)** - How requests flow through the system from transport to provider and back
- **[Concurrency](/architecture/core/concurrency)** - Worker pools and threading model
- **[MCP Integration](/architecture/core/mcp)** - Model Context Protocol implementation
- **[Plugin System](/architecture/core/plugins)** - How plugins extend core functionality

### Framework Layer
- **[What is Framework](/architecture/framework/what-is-framework)** - Shared storage and utilities overview
- **[Config Store](/architecture/framework/config-store)** - Configuration persistence patterns
- **[Log Store](/architecture/framework/log-store)** - Request logging and analytics
- **[Vector Store](/architecture/framework/vector-store)** - Semantic search and caching

### Plugins & Transports
- **[Plugin Architecture](/architecture/core/plugins)** - Plugin development patterns and execution model
- **[Transport Layer](/architecture/transports/in-memory-store)** - HTTP and other transport implementations

<Note>Reading the architecture documentation will help you understand where to make changes and how different components interact.</Note>
